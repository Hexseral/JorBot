## Project Components

- **Arduino Board:** Choose a suitable Arduino board like Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano for connecting and controlling hardware.

- **Ethernet Shield or Wi-Fi Module:** To enable network connectivity, you can use an Ethernet shield or a Wi-Fi module like ESP8266 or ESP32.

- **REST API:** Set up a REST API on your server to handle incoming JSON requests and responses. You can use frameworks like Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js).

- **Speaker:** Connect a speaker to the Arduino for playing back generated responses. A simple amplified speaker can work.

- **Microphone (Optional):** If you want the robot to capture user input, you'll need a microphone connected to the Arduino.

- **Power Supply:** Provide power to the Arduino and other components. Depending on the power requirements, you might need a battery pack or an AC adapter.

- **Wires and Breadboard:** Connect components using jumper wires and a breadboard for prototyping.

- **Programming Tools:** Use the Arduino IDE to write and upload code to the Arduino. For the server, you'll need a programming language suitable for building APIs.

- **OpenAI API Key:** To interact with the language model, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. This requires signing up for access.
