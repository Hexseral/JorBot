# JorBot - Intelligent Robot Interaction System

Welcome to JorBot, an innovative project that combines cutting-edge technology and creative engineering to create an intelligent robot interaction system. This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Arduino, REST API, and OpenAI to enable a robot to communicate with users, generating responses using advanced language models.

## Features

- Seamless communication between an Arduino-based robot and a server through JSON requests.
- Utilization of REST API to handle user messages and responses, powered by Flask and OpenAI.
- Integration of a speaker for playing back generated responses and capturing user attention.
- Optional microphone input for capturing user queries and inputs.
- Modular code structure for easy customization and expansion.

## Components

To successfully build JorBot, you will need the following components:

- **Arduino Board:** Choose a suitable Arduino board like Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano for connecting and controlling hardware.

- **Ethernet Shield or Wi-Fi Module:** To enable network connectivity, you can use an Ethernet shield or a Wi-Fi module like ESP8266 or ESP32.

- **REST API:** Set up a REST API on your server to handle incoming JSON requests and responses. You can use frameworks like Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js).

- **Speaker:** Connect a speaker to the Arduino for playing back generated responses. A simple amplified speaker can work.

- **Microphone (Optional):** If you want the robot to capture user input, you'll need a microphone connected to the Arduino.

- **Power Supply:** Provide power to the Arduino and other components. Depending on the power requirements, you might need a battery pack or an AC adapter.

- **Wires and Breadboard:** Connect components using jumper wires and a breadboard for prototyping.

- **Programming Tools:** Use the Arduino IDE to write and upload code to the Arduino. For the server, you'll need a programming language suitable for building APIs.

- **OpenAI API Key:** To interact with the language model, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. This requires signing up for access.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE: [Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Python 3.x with Flask: Install using `pip install flask`
- OpenAI API Key: [Sign Up](https://beta.openai.com/signup/)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jorbot.git`
2. Connect your Arduino board, speaker, and optional microphone to the appropriate pins.
3. Configure your server's IP address and API endpoints in the Arduino code.
4. Set up the Flask server on your machine by running `python app.py`.
5. Obtain your OpenAI API key and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `app.py`.
6. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.

### Usage

1. Power up your Arduino-based robot and ensure it's connected to the network.
2. Users can interact with the robot by sending JSON messages to the server's API endpoints.
3. The Flask server processes user messages, generates responses using OpenAI, and sends them back.
4. The robot plays the generated responses on the speaker, creating an interactive experience.
